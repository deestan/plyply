 <h2>Nobody reads them</h2>
 Confirmation dialogs train users to instantly hit the OK button whenever they
 see it, like a game of whack-a-mole.  This is because they always
 <em>really</em> ask "press this button to do whatever it was you wanted to do".
 <h2>They ask inane questions</h2>
 Even in cases where there is low chance of the user performing an operation by
 accident, and the consequences of that operation would at any rate be easily
 reversible, popup confirmation dialogs are used.
 <table>
  <tr>
   <td>User:</td>
   <td><computery-text>File > Servers > bob > Connect</computery-text></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Program:</td>
   <td>WARNING! Are you sure you want to connect to bob?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>User:</td>
   <td>Oops! No, I really wanted to print a document!  Thank <strong>a god</strong>
       you saved me from accidentally connecting to my file server.</td>
  </tr>
 </table>

 <h2>This is not a fresh insight</h2>
 People have been saying this for years. With eloquent writing, pretty illustrations,
 and large amounts of detailed critique, confirmation dialogs have been deemed
 <a href=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/04/windows-vista-security-through-endless-warning-dialogs.html>frustrating</a>,
 <a href=http://imlocation.wordpress.com/2007/07/10/fact-warning-and-confirmation-dialogs-do-not-work>pointless</a>,
 and
 <a href=http://www.philweber.com/articles/why_message_boxes_are_evil.htm>evil</a>.
 So why won't they <diediedie>die</diediedie>?

 <h2>How can we get rid of this nonsense?</h2>
 The biggest problem is that <strong>they are everywhere</strong>. It's an accidental
 industry standard. Developers are used to seeing these dialogs all over the
 place, and think nothing of adding them to their own programs whenever they
 are unsure about something.
 <h2>We need to make everyone sick of them</h2>
 <p>
  My proposed solution is simple: Shove the blasted confirmation dialogs so far
  down the throat of every developer in the world that they will forevermore
  retch just from <strong>thinking</strong> about the things.
 </p>
 <p>
  Windows programs are by far the biggest problem area, so I've started there.
  <strong>I have created a small program that every 10-40 minutes throws up the
  following focus-stealing dialog:</strong>
 </p>
 <figure>
  <img alt="WARNING! Are You Sure? OK CANCEL" src=ays.png onclick="alert('Nope! Chuck Testa.');">
  <figcaption>
   This was the crummiest, most annoying dialog I was able to make:
   It is ugly, it has an excessive but uninformative title, it provides no
   context, and the available buttons aren't semantically valid answers to
   the stated question.
   <wistful>Yet it is a completely average, run-of-the-mill confirmation dialog.</wistful>
  </figcaption>
 </figure>
 <h2>You can help!</h2>
 <p>
  <a href=AreYouSure.exe type=application/x-msdownload>Download</a>
  the program
  (or the <a href=AreYouSure.sln.zip type=application/zip>source code</a>),
  put it on a usb stick, and
  start it up on your computer, your colleagues' computers, your friends'
  computers,
  <jk-please-dont-its-illegal>voting machines</jk-please-dont-its-illegal>,
  and every piece of hardware you come across.
 </p>
 <p>
  They'll thank you in the long run.
